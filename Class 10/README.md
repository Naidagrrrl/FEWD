# Class 9 Materials

Today, we learn about variables and while we're at it, we're going to work with a bunch of different operators in Javascript.  Finally, we'll be talking about a new method in jQuery that lets us start learning how to manipulate the DOM.

## Objectives

By the end of class, you should:

<ul>
  <li>Understand what variables are and how to declare and assign them in Javascript.</li>
  <li>Know what an operator is and understand how they are used.</li>
  <li>Understand how to use the jQuery text() method to modify text in the DOM.</li>
</ul>

## Homework

Now that we've started the Javascript portion of our curriculum, your final projects will take centerstage in your homework assignments.  **Before next class your project concepts are due.**

Submit them to me over Slack.  You may submt:

- A type written description of your project
- Draw a concept on paper and photograph it
- Mock up a design in Photoshop, Powerpoint, or some other static electronic format
- Create a prototype using Sketch or some other prototyping software and submit a video

Please make sure to provide some explanation of your goals and objectives.
