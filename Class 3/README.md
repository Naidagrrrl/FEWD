## Homework

You've learned a lot in a very short period.  You should be proud of that.  

Take what you've learned and complete the 2 additional layouts for the Marketing with Nav and Magazine style.  There's no starter code, just what you come up with to layout these two designs.

Next class, we'll be learning about positioning and with that we'll start working from some actual design files, that you will reproduce! An example image of one such design is in the folder with the layout images.  If you're feeling industrious, go ahead and try your hand at laying out the design!

## Don't forget your eval!
