# Class 5 Materials

By now, you already have all of the knowledge to build a complete web page.  Class 5 will be adding to that knowledge by introducing some new tags for forms (we'll do a deeper dive on this topic later), advanced CSS for positioning elements and finally, pseudo classes and pseudo elements.  We'll also be building a skeleton of our Startup Matchmaker website that we'll revist over the next couple of classes to enhance it with new features.

Startup Matchmaker is a pretty advance website, but we'll build it little-by-little, so that you can see how real world web pages come together.  All that practice will certainly help you as you start thinking about your final projects.

## Review

We're now moving into more advanced topics, so make sure you feel comfortable with the basics from weeks 1 and 2.  Are you confident with all of the these?  Which ones still feel like they need more explanation?

<ul>
  <li>Creating a basic HTML page boilerplate with the DOCTYPE, html, head, title and body tags.</li>
  <li>Applying HTML tags to web page content</li>
  <li>Styling elements with CSS</li>
  <li>Linking external CSS files</li>
  <li>Adding images to the page and background</li>
  <li>Adding padding and margins to elements</li>
  <li>Using fixed and relative units of measurement</li>
  <li>Identifying block and inline elements</li>
  <li>Understanding the CSS box model</li>
  <li>Applying colors with different color value types</li>
  <li>Using classes and IDs to style elements</li>
  <li>The basics for laying out a page with floats, flexbox and grid</li>
</ul>

## Objectives

Class 5 advances your knowledge and lays the ground work for Responsive Web Design, which we'll be tackling in Class 6 and Animations in Class 7.  It also rounds out our knowledge about special pseudo classes we'll use both in CSS and Javascript!

<ul>
  <li>Use inputs on your web page</li>
  <li>Precisely place elements through CSS positioning and transforms</li>
  <li>Use pseudo elements to add content through CSS</li>
  <li>Use pseudo classes to select elements in the DOM</li>
</ul>
