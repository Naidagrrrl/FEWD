### Week 2 Advanced CSS

This week is about more complex CSS topics, including floats and positioning elements on the page in addition to creating DIVs and differentiating between classes and IDs.

This web project has 2 parts. This week start building a single column layout.  Your homework will be to complete the work on the Relaxr pages and to see if you can complete the [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/) game.
