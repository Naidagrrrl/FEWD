Work on completing your portfolio and about pages.  These will be submitted next class.

1. Add your own profile image.

3. Use the `<nav>` and `<main>` and `<footer>` tags. 
4. Use the `text-transform` property on your subheadings to make them display the text as uppercase.
5. Make sure to use at least one combinator.
