# HOMEWORK

## FEWD Week #1: HTML/CSS Basics

**Congratulations!**  Week 1 is behind you.  It's always tough in the beginning figuring things out, but you made it.  It does get easier in the next couple of weeks.  The material gets more in depth, but you'll have already figured out your resources and how to optimize your learning.

### Instructions
The homework for this weekend is simple.  Take it easy.  Practice a little of what you've learned and revisit some of the things we talked about by looking through the slides and finishing up your portfolio pages.
