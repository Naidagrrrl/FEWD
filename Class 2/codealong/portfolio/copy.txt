Learning something new is not easy, but it is admirable. Be excited about this adventure in learning something new. Don't be afraid. And, don't worry if you don't get everything right away. It will come. Just stick with it. Albert Einstein once said:

Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m so smart, itâ€™s just that I stay with problems longer.
