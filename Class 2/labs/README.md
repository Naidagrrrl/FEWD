## LAB 1: IMAGES & FLOATS
Instructions:

1. Download the starter code in GitHub.  You can download the entire contents of the repository by clicking the green **Clone or download** button.  Then, choose **Download ZIP**
2. Unzip the file by double-clicking on it and copy the lab1 folder to your desktop.
3. There are 3 images in the image folder.  Add each one to the index.html.
4. Float the images using CSS.  You can use an inline style, if you wish to alternate the images floating left and right.
5. Make sure to clear the floats and add the overflow property to the make sure that the sections don't collapse.
6. Finally, float the two list of links in the footer nav next to one another.


## LAB 2: MORE CSS
Instructions:

Grandma is pretty happy, but we can do better:

1. Grandma's recipe needs more work so open the the index.html and the styles.css files in the lab3 folder.
2. The body needs 20px of space between the border and the text.
3. Change the h1 font-size to 8% of the width of the smaller of the height or width of the viewport so it scales with the screen size!
4. Select just the words: "MMMMMM COOKIES!!!!" in the Nutrition Information and make them bold
5. Insert the cookie image into the page above the first heading and set its width to be 100% so it scales to fit the width of its container.
6. Let's group each of the ingredients and instructions inside a set of section tags.
7. You'll need to set both the ingredients and instruction sections to be 50% in width and then float them both to the left, so they fit next to one another.
8. Make sure you address the nutrition section so that it doesn't float with the other sections.
9. Lastly, let's give the nutrition section some additional padding, but just on top! Make it 20px.
